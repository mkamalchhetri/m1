<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>Our mission is to provide the information about Townsville Music Centre to its customer through
    responsive website, so as increase the user engagement in website. </p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> we are using open source lightweight, mobile first web development frameworks like bootstrap, jquery .
    Mobile first design will help to reach the market of smart phone users. So, our re-designed website has high probability
    for increased number of new recruited members, sales of the tickets for the concerts, number of concerts
    requested by the users to organise for them and user engagement</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>We "specialise in diversity" i.e. we provide performance opportunities for a very wide range of styles and genres which
    would otherwise have little exposure, therefore our target audience includes a wide range of ages and tastes.
    To be specific the targeted users will be the population of age group above twenty with different taste for the music.
    The website will allow them to obtain information, buy tickets for concert, request performance and provide feedback from their
    handheld devices conveniently.

            <br/> Looking Back - The first 30 years!
            <br/>
            <br/> Print music
            <br/> The Townsville Community Music Centre celebrated its 30th year in 2013.
            <br/> It has been constantly changing over the years to keep up to date with the musical tastes and needs of the
            Townsville community. As part of the relocation of the Music Centre to the Civic Theatre, Bronia Renison
            and Jean Dartnall, both librarians, have assessed the old collection of sheet music, books and recorded music
            which the centre has been storing, unused, for many years. Sometimes older things have to be discarded to
            make way for the new, but the Music Centre is aware that older material may still have value. The National
            Library of Australia has an online catalogue (TROVE) that lists not only its own holdings but also information
            about items held by many other libraries around Australia. Using this catalogue Bronia and Jean have identified
            at least 150 items of music that are not held by any of the country's major libraries. These items have been
            donated to the National Library to include in their collection and thus made available to all historians
            and musicians.
            <br/> Also discovered in the old collection were some pieces relevant to North Queensland. Local musicians performed
            these at a musical social afternoon on Sunday April 21st in C2 at the Civic Theatre. The remaining sheet
            music, books and CDs were put on display and distributed free of charge to the local music community.
            <br/>
            <br/> A Brief History by Jean Dartnall
            <br/> 1983 The Townsville Community Music Centre was established at a public meeting on May 24th. Then Deputy
            Mayor, Ken McElligott, opened the meeting and presented a cheque for $50 from the City Council to cover initial
            petty cash, the Centre's first funds. At the meeting an executive committee was formed. Over the next few
            weeks that committee drafted a constitution which was endorsed at another public meeting on June 15th. Fred
            Thompson was Chairman from September 1983, with Gordon Dean as his Deputy and Jan Eagleton as Secretary.
            <br/> 1984 - Mira Henderson, who had extensive experience in community music work in England, was the first staff
            member. (Her position was Acting Director because she was only in Townsville for a brief spell.) She instigated
            a series of classes starting in 1984 using the skills of people living in Townsville to enhance and encourage
            music learners of all ages.
            <br/> 1985 - Kirsty Veron was appointed as the first Director. Kirsty was very interested in teaching music to
            children and had worked with Mira in the 1983 classes. She held this position until 1988 leading the new
            organisation into a strong position in the Townsville arts community.
            <br/> 1985 - The Music Centre produced Benjamin Britten's Noyes Fludde in St James Anglican Cathedral. This involved
            hundreds of children and some of Townsville's best known (and loved) musicians. It was produced by Rachel
            Berker (now Rachel Matthews) and involved Bernie Lannigan and Sandra Voss in the main parts rehearsed by
            Bill Williams; Donna McMahon and Jenny Carr rehearsing the strings and recorders and guest conductor Donald
            Hollier. This was by the no means the only major production mounted by the Music Centre but was probably
            the largest.
            <br/> 1987 - This was the year of the first fund raising dinner. These dinners became a tradition as they were
            a wonderful mixture of good food, good wine and good music. The first ones were held at the home of Paul
            and June Tonnoir in North Ward. Later they moved to the Bishop's Lodge as guests of the Anglican Bishop.
            Attendees would often book their tickets for the next year's dinner as soon as they had attended this one.
            They ran until 2004.
            <br/> 1988 - Mary Lou Schoenfeldt was appointed as Administrator. Although this was initially a small part time
            job with limited responsibilities, Mary Lou made the job, the Centre and indeed music in Townsville, her
            own. She was a wonderful asset to the Centre and to the cultural life of the City until she had to retire
            due to ill health in 2003.


            <br/>1990 - This year the first lunchtime concert was held at the PercTucker Gallery. The importance of providing
            performance opportunities for emerging musicians had become evident and from this time, for a number of years,
            one of the major activities of the Centre was the production and management of concerts.

            <br/>1999 - Arts Queensland had been a major funder of Music Centre activities for a number of years but in this
            year they agree to provide funding on a three year basis. This made it much easier for the Centre to plan
            ahead and reduced the time that had to be spent on repetitive grant applications. This arrangement ran until
            2004.

            <br/>2003 - A spectacular variety concert was held at the Townsville Civic Theatre to celebrate twenty years of
            the Music Centre and as a tribute to May Lou.

            <br/>2005 - The Centre moved to offices in the Old Magistrate's Court. More details of the period 1983 - 2008
            can be found in the book, "Townsville Community Music Centre: some memories of the first 25 years" by Jean
            Dartnall. (Copies available from the Music Centre)

            <br/> 2012 - The Centre moved to its present office in the Townsville Civic Theatre building.

            Our Parish Priest, Fr Mick Peters, is trying to development and foster a community for our 6 PM Vigil Mass at St Josephs
            on the Strand. I'm helping by organising an event format, where I invite our members to bring a plate for
            a buffet and I provide music, or friends who can sing or perform. Now that we are achieving some success,
            we need more people who can sing or play music. I'm open to any kind of singing or performing so long as
            it is not too controversial. My preference would be for an artist to sing a medley of old time favorites.
            Mass starts at 6pm and finishes about 10 to 7.
